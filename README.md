**R-Lectures** is a repository of collection of teaching material I use during my teaching at the University of Bayreuth.

If you are a beginner in R, you should start from the first lecture and go through the material in order. In case you are here to find a specific topic, you can check the table of contents below and jump to the topic you are interested in. Depending on the course I teach, there are minor differences in the content for each lecture, but the overall structure is the same.


## Lecture 1 - Getting Started
This lecture is an introduction to R, statistics and object-oriented programming. You will find the slides to the lecture and the R script. My recommendation is to always have the native programming language in your own system, but you can also just use [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com) or any other online platform that allows you to run R code. This is what I do in the *Data Science in Economic History* course.

I would recommend you to check out the following resources, as I prepared my material based mostly on them. Any other resource will give you also a very similar content, if you rather prefer going your own way. For some data that you would like to play around with, check out [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [**UCI Machine Learning Repository**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
