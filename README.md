**R-Lectures** is a repository of collection of teaching material I use during my teaching at the University of Bayreuth.

If you are a beginner in R, you should start from the first lecture and go through the material in order. In case you are here to find a specific topic, you can check the table of contents below and jump to the topic you are interested in. Depending on the course I teach, there are minor differences in the content for each lecture, but the overall structure is the same.

## Lecture 1 - Getting Started
This lecture is an introduction to R, statistics, and object-oriented programming. You will find the slides for the lecture and the R script. My recommendation is to always have the native programming language in your own system, but you can also just use [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com) or any other online platform that allows you to run R code. This is what I do in the *Data Science in Economic History* courses.

## Lecture 2 - Basic Programming and Statistics
We continue where we left off by taking a closer look at vectors, dataframes, and core concepts in R.

## Lecture 3 - Probability and Statistical Calculations
After learning about the data structure and basic syntax in R, we can now talk about probability.

## Lecture 4 - ggplot2 and sf
In this lecture, we will learn about the **ggplot2** package and how to visualize data. We will also learn about the **sf** package and how to work with spatial data.

I would recommend that you check out the following resources, as I prepared my material based mostly on them. Any other resource will also give you very similar content if you prefer going your own way.
